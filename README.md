# 3D Gaussian Splatting Project
This **Temporal 3D Reconstruction of Cultural Heritage using Gaussian Splatting** focuses on leveraging advanced Gaussian Splatting (GS) techniques to model and visualize temporal changes in cultural heritage sites. The objective is to capture and highlight transformations caused by natural degradation or environmental factors over time. Through innovative visualization techniques, the project aims to create a "time capsule" model that preserves and analyzes these sites, contributing to their long-term digital preservation.


## Acknoledgements

This project was developed to explore the potential of Gaussian Splatting techniques for cultural heritage preservation, as part of the project exam for the course [Augmented and Virtual Reality](https://corsi.unige.it/off.f/2023/ins/66562) during Master's degree in Computer Engineering - Artifical Intelligence at the University of Genova.
